# Exploring OpenGL on MacOS

The purpose of this project is to explore the basics of OpenGL programming on MacOS using C++. I will be following [this guide](https://capnramses.github.io/opengl/hellotriangle.html).

The code contained in here is by no means optimised but is engineered more towards making the concepts of 3D programming clearer for educational purposes. 

## Requirements

- The latest version of [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) and [MacOS](http://www.apple.com/lae/macos/sierra/). Both are free.
- The [GLFW library source](http://www.glfw.org/download.html) which will deal with windowing and user input.
- The latest [CMake binaries](https://cmake.org/download/) for MacOS/OSX to build the GLFW source.
- A Mac with a video card that supports OpenGL 3.3 and up. I have a Mac with OpenGL 4.1. [Check this table](https://developer.apple.com/opengl/capabilities/).

## Building and installing GLFW from source

- [This guide](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~sugih/courses/eecs487/glut-howto/glfw/) is up to date and outlines how to get GLFW set up for OSX.
